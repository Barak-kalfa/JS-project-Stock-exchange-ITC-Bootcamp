# How To Approach This Code:
This project (and all other projects from the bootcamp) are a way to show my learning curve and were made in a program that requires you to learn the material and write the project at the same time. Therefore this and other projects are full of flaws that I am aware of. I decided not to invest time in refactoring my code or hiding git mistakes and to use this time to learn new things that were not included in the bootcamp like data structures, algorithms, and more.
